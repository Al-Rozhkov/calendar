The module includes plug-in themes for Views to display available date fields
in calendar displays. To use them, select the Calendar display as the 
page type for your view and add any date fields you want to display on the calendar
as fields to the view. Date fields can include CCK date fields, event start and end
dates, or dates like the node created or updated dates.

Add three arguments to the view: Calendar Year, Calendar Month, and Calendar Day, in
that order. Set each of them to 'Display All Values'.

A mini calendar is available using the block view if the block view is also set
to the Calendar type.
