Creates calendar displays of Views results.

Create a new calendar by enabling or cloning the default calendar,
changing the date argument to use the correct date field(s), and setting
up the year, month, day, week, and block views with the desired styles 
and fields.

If the Calendar iCal module is enabled, an iCal feed can be
attached to the view.

For a quick and easy start, install the Date Tools module, then use
the Date Tools Wizard to create a content type with a date field
and a calendar that displays that field, all in a single step!
