Creates calendar displays of Views results.

Create a new calendar by enabling or cloning the default calendar,
changing the date argument to use the correct date field(s), and setting
up the year, month, day, week, and block views with the desired styles 
and fields.

If the Calendar iCal module is enabled, an iCal feed can be
attached to the view.
